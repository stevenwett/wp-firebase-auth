* Click Generate new private key and it'll show you some json to copy. To see an example see #Example google-service-account.json
* Add json to file named google-service-account.json that is in the /private folder.

#### Example google-service-account.json

{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "",
  "private_key_id": "",
  "private_key": "",
  "client_email": "",
  "client_id": "",
